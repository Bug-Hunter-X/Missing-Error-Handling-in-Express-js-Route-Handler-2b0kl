# Express.js Route Handler Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description

The buggy code attempts to access a user based on an ID passed as a route parameter. However, it fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid integer, resulting in potential errors.

## Solution

The solution includes comprehensive error handling, validating the user ID and gracefully handling cases where the user is not found or the ID is invalid.
